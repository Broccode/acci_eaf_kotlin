# Story 4.3: UI for Local User Management within a Tenant

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a Control Plane Administrator (or Tenant Administrator, if the UI later supports tenant-level admin logins and the logged-in user has appropriate rights for the selected tenant)
- I want a UI section to manage local users within a selected tenant (List, Create, View, Edit, Manage Status, Reset Password)
- so that tenant user administration can be done visually.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Within a tenant's detail view or a dedicated "User Management" section (clearly scoped to a tenant and only accessible when a tenant is selected/in context), a data grid/table displays the local users of that tenant (columns: e.g., Username, Email, Status, Creation Date). Pagination, filtering, and sorting are supported.
2. Forms and actions allow creating new local users (Username, Email, initial Password â€“ password entered masked and only used for API submission), viewing user details, editing user information (e.g., Email, Status), and triggering password resets (calling APIs from Story 3.2). Validation, error handling, and loading states are implemented as described in Story 4.2.
3. User status (Active, Locked, Disabled) can be managed via the UI, including confirmation dialogs for critical status changes.
4. When creating a user or resetting a password, server-defined password strength policies (if any) are indicated client-side (e.g., as a tooltip) and validated server-side; corresponding API error messages are displayed.
5. The UI never displays plaintext or hashed passwords at any time.
6. Attempting to create a user whose username already exists within the tenant context results in a clear error message.
7. User interactions are intuitive and consistent with the rest of the Control Plane.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Setup User Management Section within Tenant Context** (AC: #1)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Determine and implement how the User Management section is accessed (e.g., as a tab within Tenant Details view from Story 4.2, or a separate page that requires a tenant context).
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Ensure the User Management section is clearly scoped to the selected/active tenant. Display tenant identifier prominently.
- [ ] **Task 2: Implement User List View** (AC: #1, #7)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Create a React component for displaying users of the selected tenant in a data grid (e.g., using React-Admin `<List>`, `<Datagrid>`).
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Define columns: Username, Email, Status, Creation Date. Consider if other fields from API (Story 3.2) are relevant.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Implement pagination, sorting, and filtering for the user list (similar to Tenant List in Story 4.2).
  - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Integrate with the user listing API for the specific tenant (from `eaf-iam` via `eaf-controlplane-api`, see Story 3.2).
  - [ ] Subtask 2.5: Implement loading indicators and error display for data fetching.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.6: Ensure UI elements follow React-Admin style and patterns established in Story 4.1 and 4.2.
- [ ] **Task 3: Implement User Creation** (AC: #2, #4, #5, #6, #7)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Create a React component for the user creation form (e.g., React-Admin `<Create>`, `<SimpleForm>`).
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Add input fields: Username, Email, Initial Password (masked).
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Implement client-side validation (required fields, email format).
  - [ ] Subtask 3.4: Display server-defined password strength policies (if available from API or documentation) as a tooltip or helper text.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.5: Integrate with the user creation API for the specific tenant (Story 3.2). Ensure password is sent securely and not stored/displayed client-side.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.6: Implement user-friendly display of API validation errors (e.g., username exists, password policy violation) and success/error notifications (toasts).
  - [ ] Subtask 3.7: Ensure loading states during form submission.
- [ ] **Task 4: Implement User Detail View** (AC: #2, #5, #7)
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Create a React component for displaying user details (e.g., React-Admin `<Show>`, `<SimpleShowLayout>`).
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Display relevant user information (Username, Email, Status, Creation Date, etc.) in a read-only format. Do NOT display password.
  - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Integrate with the user detail API for the specific tenant (Story 3.2).
- [ ] **Task 5: Implement User Editing** (AC: #2, #5, #7)
  - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Create a React component for the user editing form (e.g., React-Admin `<Edit>`, `<SimpleForm>`).
  - [ ] Subtask 5.2: Add input fields for editable user properties (e.g., Email). Username should likely be read-only after creation. Status is managed separately (Task 6). Password reset is a separate action (Task 7).
  - [ ] Subtask 5.3: Implement client-side validation.
  - [ ] Subtask 5.4: Integrate with the user update API for the specific tenant (Story 3.2).
  - [ ] Subtask 5.5: Implement user-friendly display of API validation errors and success/error notifications.
  - [ ] Subtask 5.6: Ensure loading states during form submission.
- [ ] **Task 6: Implement User Status Management** (AC: #3, #7)
  - [ ] Subtask 6.1: Add action buttons/menu items in the user list and/or detail view for managing user status (e.g., Activate, Lock, Disable).
  - [ ] Subtask 6.2: Implement confirmation dialogs before performing status change actions.
  - [ ] Subtask 6.3: Integrate with the user status update API for the specific tenant (Story 3.2).
  - [ ] Subtask 6.4: Ensure the user list updates correctly after the action without requiring a manual refresh.
  - [ ] Subtask 6.5: Display success/error notifications.
- [ ] **Task 7: Implement Password Reset Action** (AC: #2, #4, #5, #7)
  - [ ] Subtask 7.1: Add an action (e.g., button in user detail view or list) to trigger a password reset.
  - [ ] Subtask 7.2: This might involve a modal asking for a new password (if admins can set it directly) or just confirming the reset action (if it triggers an email or a temporary password). Clarify flow based on API capabilities (Story 3.2). For MVP, assume admin sets a temporary password.
  - [ ] Subtask 7.3: Input for new password (if applicable) should be masked. Display password policies.
  - [ ] Subtask 7.4: Implement confirmation dialog.
  - [ ] Subtask 7.5: Integrate with the password reset API for the specific tenant (Story 3.2).
  - [ ] Subtask 7.6: Display success/error notifications.
- [ ] **Task 8: Code Quality and Documentation**
  - [ ] Subtask 8.1: Write unit/integration tests for new components and services, focusing on UI interactions and data provider logic for users.
  - [ ] Subtask 8.2: Ensure code adheres to project linting and formatting rules (`npm run lint`).
  - [ ] Subtask 8.3: Verify alignment with `docs/project-structure.md`, `docs/ACCI-EAF-Frontend.md` and `controlplane-ui` conventions (React-Admin, Material-UI).

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Module:** `controlplane-ui`
- **Framework:** React, Vite, TypeScript.
- **UI Library:** React-Admin with Material-UI components. Maintain consistency with Story 4.1 and 4.2 implementations.
- **API Integration:**
  - All user management operations will interface with the APIs defined and implemented in Story 3.2 (User Management in `eaf-iam`) and exposed via `eaf-controlplane-api`.
  - The context for these operations is **always a specific tenant**. API calls will likely require a `tenantId` path parameter or similar.
  - Refer to `docs/api-reference.md` or the OpenAPI specification for `eaf-controlplane-api` (especially endpoints related to Story 3.2) for precise endpoints, request/response payloads, and error codes.
- **State Management:**
  - Continue using React-Admin's data providers. You may need to create a new data provider or extend the existing one to handle user-specific CRUD operations within a tenant context.
  - Consider how the `tenantId` context will be passed to the data provider methods. This might involve React context or custom hooks.
- **Component Structure:**
  - New components should reside under a path like `controlplane-ui/src/components/users/` or within the tenant management page structure if tightly coupled (e.g., `controlplane-ui/src/pages/TenantManagementPage/UserList.tsx`).
  - Examples: `UserList.tsx`, `UserCreate.tsx`, `UserEdit.tsx`, `UserShow.tsx`.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Follow patterns from Story 4.2: User-friendly API error messages, toast notifications, global error handling.
  - Pay special attention to password policy errors and username conflict errors.
- **Styling:** Adhere to Material-UI theme and React-Admin styling from previous stories.
- **Permissions:** This story assumes an administrator role. Finer-grained RBAC for who can manage users within a tenant will be handled in later stories if required.
- **Security:**
  - Never display passwords.
  - Ensure password input fields are of `type="password"`.
  - Handle password reset functionality with care, ensuring new passwords are not exposed unnecessarily.
