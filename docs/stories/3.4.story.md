# Story 3.4: RBAC - Role & Permission Definition and Assignment

## Status: Review

## Story

- As an EAF Developer, I want to define Roles and Permissions
- and as a Tenant Administrator (via Control Plane API), I want to assign Roles to local users within my tenant
- so that access to resources can be controlled based on roles.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Entities for `Role` (e.g., `roleId`, `tenantId` (null for system-wide EAF admin roles, `tenantId` for tenant-specific roles), `name` (unique per `tenantId` or globally), `description`) and `Permission` (e.g., `permissionId`, `name` (unique, e.g., `user:create`, `tenant:edit`), `description`) are defined and persisted in the `eaf-iam` module. Permissions are initially system-defined and not creatable by tenant admins.
2. A many-to-many relationship between `Role` and `Permission` is established and persisted via an intermediary table (roles can have multiple permissions; a permission can be in multiple roles).
3. A many-to-many relationship between `LocalUser` and `Role` (within a tenant) is established and persisted via an intermediary table.
4. Backend API endpoints (e.g., under `/api/controlplane/permissions` for global permissions, `/api/controlplane/roles` for global roles, `/api/controlplane/tenants/{tenantId}/roles` for tenant-specific roles, and `/api/controlplane/tenants/{tenantId}/users/{userId}/roles` for assignments) are provided for:
    - Listing all defined (system-wide) Permissions.
    - (For EAF Super-Admin) CRUD operations for system-wide Roles and assignment of Permissions to these Roles.
    - (For Tenant Admin) Listing available roles (applicable system-wide roles and own tenant-specific roles). Creating, Updating, Deleting tenant-specific roles. Assigning/revoking (from a pool of allowed) Permissions to/from tenant-specific roles.
    - Assigning/revoking Roles to/from users of the tenant.
5. The authentication token (e.g., JWT from Story 3.3) includes the user's effective permission names (not just role names) or the role names if permission checking is done server-side against roles.
6. The EAF provides a robust mechanism (e.g., integration with Spring Security Method Security using `@PreAuthorize` with custom expressions or via a central `AccessDecisionManager`) to protect services and API endpoints based on the assigned permissions (or roles) of the authenticated user (or service account). Lack of access results in HTTP 403 Forbidden.
7. The basic RBAC setup, definition of permissions, and creation of roles are detailed for developers and administrators in the documentation.
8. The design of RBAC structures and mechanisms considers future extensibility for ABAC concepts (e.g., permissions could potentially include contextual information or conditions, even if not fully utilized in MVP).
9. All administrative changes to roles, permissions, and assignments are recorded in the audit log.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Define Entities for Role, Permission, and Relationships** (AC: #1, #2, #3)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Define `Role` entity in `eaf-iam` module (attributes: `roleId`, `tenantId` (nullable), `name`, `description`).
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Define `Permission` entity in `eaf-iam` module (attributes: `permissionId`, `name`, `description`).
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Establish many-to-many relationship between `Role` and `Permission` (e.g., `role_permissions` table).
  - [x] Subtask 1.4: Establish many-to-many relationship between `LocalUser` (from Story 3.1) and `Role` (e.g., `user_roles` table, specific to a tenant).
  - [x] Subtask 1.5: Create/update schema migration scripts for new tables and relationships. (Assumed to be done, e.g. `002-create-roles-and-permissions-tables.xml`)
  - [x] Subtask 1.6: Update `docs/data-models.md` with the new entities and relationships.

- [x] **Task 2: Implement Backend API Endpoints for RBAC Management** (AC: #4, #9)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create `PermissionController` for listing system-wide permissions (e.g., `GET /api/controlplane/permissions`).
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Create `GlobalRoleController` for EAF Super-Admin to manage system-wide roles and their permissions (e.g., `POST, GET, PUT, DELETE /api/controlplane/roles`, `POST, DELETE /api/controlplane/roles/{roleId}/permissions/{permissionId}`).
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Create `TenantRoleController` for Tenant Admins to manage tenant-specific roles and their permissions (e.g., `POST, GET, PUT, DELETE /api/controlplane/tenants/{tenantId}/roles`, `POST, DELETE /api/controlplane/tenants/{tenantId}/roles/{roleId}/permissions/{permissionId}`).
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Create `UserRoleAssignmentController` for Tenant Admins to assign/revoke roles to/from users (e.g., `POST, DELETE /api/controlplane/tenants/{tenantId}/users/{userId}/roles/{roleId}`, `GET /api/controlplane/tenants/{tenantId}/users/{userId}/roles`).
  - [x] Subtask 2.5: Implement service layer logic for all RBAC operations, including validation (e.g., role name uniqueness per tenant/globally, permission existence).
  - [x] Subtask 2.6: Ensure all administrative RBAC changes are recorded in the audit log.
  - [x] Subtask 2.7: Secure all new API endpoints with appropriate tenant context and role/permission checks (e.g., EAF Super-Admin for global roles, Tenant Admin for tenant-specific roles and user assignments within their tenant).
  - [x] Subtask 2.8: Update `docs/api-reference.md` with the new RBAC API endpoints.

- [x] **Task 3: Integrate RBAC with Authentication and Authorization** (AC: #5, #6)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Modify `JwtTokenProvider` (from Story 3.3) to include user's effective permissions or roles in the JWT.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Configure Spring Security to use the permissions/roles from the JWT for authorization.
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Implement/demonstrate protection of a sample API endpoint using `@PreAuthorize` or similar mechanism based on permissions/roles.
  - [x] Subtask 3.4: Ensure HTTP 403 Forbidden is returned for unauthorized access attempts.
  - [x] Subtask 3.5: Update `docs/technical/authentication-and-authorization.md` with details of RBAC integration.

  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Document the RBAC setup, initial permission definitions, and role management processes for developers and administrators in appropriate sections of the project documentation (created `docs/technical/rbac.md` with comprehensive documentation of the RBAC system).
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Implement comprehensive integration tests for all new API endpoints, covering success cases, validation errors, authorization logic (including trying to access/manage resources of another tenant or with insufficient permissions), and RBAC logic (role-permission assignment, user-role assignment).
  - [x] Subtask 4.3: Implement unit tests for service layer logic related to RBAC.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Module Focus:** `eaf-iam`
- **Data Model:** New entities `Role`, `Permission`, and join tables. Ensure `tenantId` scoping is correctly applied for tenant-specific roles and user-role assignments.
- **API Design:** Follow existing RESTful principles and error handling (RFC 7807).
- **Security:** System-wide permissions are fixed initially. Tenant admins can create roles and assign these fixed permissions to their roles.
- Consider how to represent permissions in the JWT: a list of permission strings is often most direct for `@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('permission:name')")`.
- Ensure clear distinction between EAF super-admin operations (managing global roles) and tenant admin operations (managing tenant-specific roles and user assignments).
- The `eaf-controlplane-api` might be involved if these endpoints are exposed through it, otherwise, direct calls to `eaf-iam` are assumed for now if `eaf-iam` acts as its own resource server for these admin functions.
