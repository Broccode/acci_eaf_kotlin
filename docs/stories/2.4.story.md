# Story 2.4: Basic Control Plane API for Tenant Management (CRUD)

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a Control Plane Administrator
- I want a secure backend API to manage tenants (Create, Read, Update, Deactivate)
- so that I can administer tenant lifecycles.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. RESTful API endpoints are provided by the EAF (e.g., under `/controlplane/api/v1/tenants` as suggested in `docs/api-reference.md`) and are located in the `eaf-controlplane-api` module (as per `docs/ACCI-EAF-Architecture.md#component-view`). The API adheres to the principles of well-designed RESTful web services (correct use of HTTP methods, status codes, headers).
2. The endpoints support HTTP methods for standard CRUD operations with clearly defined JSON request and response payloads (refer to `docs/data-models.md#tenant` for base entity, and `docs/api-reference.md#7.2.1` for payload examples):
    - `POST /tenants`: Creates a new tenant. Requires a valid tenant name and optionally other initial configuration parameters (e.g., initial admin email). Validates inputs server-side (e.g., name format, length, uniqueness of name, valid email). Returns HTTP 201 Created with the full tenant object (including system-generated `tenantId`) in the body and a `Location` header on success.
    - `GET /tenants`: Lists all tenants (or a paginated subset). Supports pagination (e.g., `page`, `size` query parameters with default values and upper limits) and filtering (e.g., by `status`, free-text search in `name`). Returns HTTP 200 OK with a list of tenant objects and pagination information in the body or headers. Returns an empty list if no tenants match the criteria.
    - `GET /tenants/{tenantId}`: Retrieves details of a specific tenant by its `tenantId` (UUID format). Returns HTTP 200 OK with the tenant object on success, or HTTP 404 Not Found if the tenant with the given ID does not exist.
    - `PUT /tenants/{tenantId}`: Updates an existing tenant (e.g., name, status). Is idempotent. Validates inputs. Returns HTTP 200 OK (with the updated object) or HTTP 204 No Content on success, HTTP 404 Not Found for a non-existent tenant, HTTP 400 Bad Request for validation errors.
    - `DELETE /tenants/{tenantId}`: Deactivates (soft delete by changing status to `INACTIVE` or `ARCHIVED`) a tenant. Is idempotent. Returns HTTP 204 No Content on success, HTTP 404 Not Found for a non-existent tenant.
3. All API endpoints are secured by appropriate, robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow for M2M access, specific admin roles defined in `eaf-iam`). Unauthorized access attempts result in HTTP 401 Unauthorized; access attempts with insufficient permissions result in HTTP 403 Forbidden. (Refer to Story 3.4 for RBAC, and `docs/security-best-practices.md`).
4. API requests and responses consistently use JSON. Error responses follow a standardized format (e.g., RFC 7807 Problem Details for HTTP APIs, as per `docs/error-handling.md` and `docs/api-reference.md`). Date formats in JSON are standardized (ISO 8601).
5. All API operations that change the state of tenants (Create, Update, Delete/Deactivate) are implemented transactionally and atomically. In case of error, a rollback occurs to prevent inconsistent states.
6. Current and detailed API documentation (e.g., generated from code with OpenAPI 3.x / Swagger using `springdoc-openapi` as per `docs/tech-stack.md`) is available for these endpoints. It describes all endpoints, parameters, request/response schemas, validation rules, and possible error codes, and security requirements. (See `docs/api-reference.md#7.2.1` for expected content).
7. Comprehensive integration tests (e.g., using Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers for the database, as per `docs/testing-strategy.md`) cover all API endpoints. Tested scenarios include happy paths, all defined validation errors, authorization and authentication errors, edge cases (e.g., operation on non-existent entities, empty lists, pagination limits), and idempotency of PUT/DELETE.
8. All administrative changes to tenants (creation, update, status change) made via this API are recorded. For MVP, this can be a basic logging mechanism (e.g., structured logging to console/file via `eaf-observability` as per Story 10.1). Full integration with the central audit log (Epic 10, Story 10.7) will occur once Story 10.7 is implemented.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Module:** API implementation in `eaf-controlplane-api`. Tenant business logic resides in `eaf-multitenancy` (Story 2.1). See `docs/ACCI-EAF-Architecture.md#component-view`.
- **Project Structure & Coding Standards:** Strictly adhere to `docs/project-structure.md` and `docs/coding-standards.md` (which incorporates `docs/ide-agent-modes/dev-agent.md` guidelines and general Kotlin/Spring best practices from `docs/ACCI-EAF-Architecture.md#13.1`).
- **API Design:** Follow conventions from `docs/api-reference.md#7.2.1` and general REST best practices.
- **Data Models:** Use DTOs for API request/response payloads. Base DTOs on the `Tenant` entity in `docs/data-models.md#tenant`.
- **Error Handling:** Implement as per `docs/error-handling.md` and `docs/ACCI-EAF-Architecture.md#12`.
- **Security:** Implement authentication and authorization as per `docs/security-best-practices.md` and Story 3.4.
- **Testing:** Follow guidelines in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.
- **Audit Logging (AC #8):** Implement a basic logging placeholder. Full integration with the central audit log (Story 10.7) is deferred.

### Completion Notes List

- **Missing Information / Conflicts (to be resolved or confirmed by User/PO):**
  - **Checklist:** `docs/checklists/story-draft-checklist.md` was used for self-assessment, but formal validation by PO/User is pending.
  - Confirm if `eaf-controlplane-api` module needs to be created or already exists. If it needs creation, it should follow structure from `docs/project-structure.md` and bootstrap similar to `eaf-core` in Story 1.2.
