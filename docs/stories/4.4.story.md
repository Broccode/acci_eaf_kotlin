# Story 4.4: UI for RBAC Management (Role Assignment within a Tenant)

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a Control Plane Administrator (or Tenant Administrator with appropriate rights)
- I want a UI section to manage role assignments to users within a selected tenant
- so that access control can be configured visually.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. A UI section (e.g., in the user detail view of a local user or service account, or as a separate "Roles" tab/section) allows viewing the roles available for the current tenant (both system-wide applicable roles and tenant-specific ones, if supported later).
2. For a selected user/service account, their currently assigned roles are clearly displayed.
3. For a selected user/service account, roles can be assigned or unassigned from a list of available roles for the tenant (e.g., via a multi-select box, a list with checkboxes, drag-and-drop interface). Changes call the appropriate APIs from Story 3.4.
4. An explicit save action with a confirmation dialog is required before changes to role assignments take effect.
5. *(MVP Focus for Phase 1):* Creating/editing roles themselves and assigning permissions to roles is **not** done via the UI in this phase. The UI focuses solely on assigning *existing, predefined* roles to users/service accounts.
6. User interactions are intuitive and error-tolerant (e.g., attempting to assign a non-existent role should be prevented by UI selection).
7. Errors during saving of role assignments (e.g., API error, concurrent modification) are clearly communicated to the user. Loading states are displayed.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Module Focus

- **Frontend Module:** `controlplane-ui`
- **Primary Components Location:** `controlplane-ui/src/components/users/`
- **Service Location:** `controlplane-ui/src/services/`
- **Types Location:** `controlplane-ui/src/types/`

### API Integration

Based on the RBAC Management API from Story 3.4 (see `docs/api-reference.md#7.2.5-rbac-management-api`):

**Key Endpoints:**

1. **Get User Roles:** `GET /api/controlplane/tenants/{tenantId}/users/{userId}/roles`
   - Returns array of assigned roles with id, name, description, tenantId, and permissionIds
2. **Get Available Roles:** `GET /api/controlplane/tenants/{tenantId}/roles/available`
   - Returns both system-wide roles (tenantId: null) and tenant-specific roles
3. **Assign Role:** `POST /api/controlplane/tenants/{tenantId}/users/{userId}/roles/{roleId}`
   - Returns 204 No Content on success
4. **Remove Role:** `DELETE /api/controlplane/tenants/{tenantId}/users/{userId}/roles/{roleId}`
   - Returns 204 No Content on success

**Error Codes:**

- 400: Bad Request (invalid data)
- 401: Unauthorized (authentication required)
- 403: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- 404: Not Found (user, role, or tenant not found)

### Component Architecture

Follow the established patterns from Stories 4.1-4.3:

- Use React-Admin components and hooks where applicable
- Follow Material-UI theming and styling
- Implement loading states, error handling, and notifications consistently
- Use TypeScript for all new code

### Role Type Definition

```typescript
// src/types/role.ts
export interface Role {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  tenantId: string | null; // null for system-wide roles
  permissionIds: string[];
}
```

### UI/UX Considerations

- Role assignment should be intuitive - consider using Material-UI's Transfer List or Autocomplete with chips
- Clearly distinguish between system-wide and tenant-specific roles (e.g., different icons or labels)
- Show role descriptions to help administrators understand what each role provides
- Implement optimistic UI updates where appropriate for better perceived performance

### State Management

- Use React-Admin's built-in state management for resource data
- Local component state for dialog open/close and selection state
- Consider using React Query (if already in the project) or React-Admin's useDataProvider hook for API calls

### Security Considerations

- The UI should respect the permissions of the logged-in user
- Only show role management options if the user has `role:assign` permission
- Never expose sensitive permission details that aren't necessary for the UI

### Reusability

Design components to be reusable for service account role management (Story 4.5):

- Abstract role management logic into reusable hooks
- Make components accept entity type (user/service account) as props
- Use generic interfaces where possible

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: Claude 3.5 Sonnet

### Completion Notes List

- 2024-12-10: Completed implementation of UI for RBAC Management
  - All main components (UserRoles, RoleAssignmentDialog, roleService) were already implemented
  - Added unit tests for UserRoles component (simplified approach due to test framework constraints)
  - Added role indicator placeholder to UserList component (actual role counts await API support)
  - Updated RBAC technical documentation to include UI section
  - Note: Full integration tests deferred due to complex React-Admin test setup requirements
  - Note: Service account role management deferred to Story 4.5 as designed
- 2024-12-29: Refactored Control Plane UI to follow React-Admin best practices
  - Implemented feature-based architecture (moved from technical layers to feature modules)
  - Applied component composition patterns throughout the application
  - Improved list components with better separation of concerns
  - Created barrel exports for cleaner imports
  - Enhanced component reusability and maintainability
