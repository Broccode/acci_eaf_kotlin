# Story 1.3: Initial CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a Development Team
- I want a basic CI/CD pipeline configured for the ACCI EAF monorepo
- so that code changes are automatically built, tested (initially unit tests and code quality checks), and a deployable artifact (e.g., Docker image for `eaf-core`) is produced and scanned.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The CI pipeline (GitHub Actions Workflow) is versioned as code within the monorepo and is automatically triggered on every push to the main branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`) and on every pull/merge request to this branch.
2. The pipeline executes the command `./gradlew build cleanCheck` (including Klint and Detekt checks) to compile all modules, perform static code analysis, and run unit tests. The pipeline fails if tests fail or configured quality gates (e.g., minimum test coverage, no critical code smells) are not met. Detailed test results and analysis reports are available as pipeline artifacts.
3. The pipeline generates versioned build artifacts (e.g., JAR files for the modules) that include a manifest file with build information (e.g., Git commit ID, build timestamp, semantic version based on Git tags or build parameters).
4. The pipeline builds a Docker image for the `eaf-core` module using a multi-stage Dockerfile (optimized for minimal size, using a non-root user, correct layer structure). The image is tagged with the build version. A basic vulnerability scan of the locally built Docker image with Trivy (executed within the CI runner) is performed, and critical findings lead to pipeline failure. (Publishing to the internal Docker registry `dcaharbor.dpcm.io` will be configured in a subsequent task/story when GitHub Actions access is established).
5. The status of the pipeline (success/failure of each step) is clearly signaled in GitHub Actions and ideally also in the Git repository (e.g., as a commit status or pull request check). Notifications for failures are sent to the development team.
6. Detailed and structured logs of the pipeline execution are accessible for at least 7 days to enable efficient troubleshooting.
7. The pipeline is configured to use caching mechanisms (e.g., for Gradle dependencies, Docker layers) to optimize build times without compromising correctness.
8. The pipeline handles errors in individual steps (e.g., temporary failure of external services like artifact repositories) robustly (e.g., through retry mechanisms for certain operations) and reports them clearly.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: GitHub Actions CI/CD System Setup and Basic Configuration** (AC: #1)
  - [x] Document GitHub Actions as the chosen CI/CD system.
  - [x] Create the basic pipeline configuration file (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) in the repository.
  - [x] Configure triggers for pushes and pull requests to the main branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`).
- [x] **Task 2: Build, Test, and Quality Checks with Klint/Detekt** (AC: #2)
  - [x] Add a pipeline step to execute `./gradlew build cleanCheck` (ensure `cleanCheck` includes Klint, Detekt, and unit tests).
  - [x] Configure the pipeline to fail if the Gradle command returns a non-zero exit code.
  - [x] Configure GitHub Actions to archive and make available test reports and static analysis reports (Klint, Detekt) as build artifacts.
- [x] **Task 3: Artifact Generation and Versioning** (AC: #3)
  - [x] Configure Gradle to produce necessary build artifacts (e.g., JARs for `eaf-core`).
  - [x] Implement a strategy for versioning build artifacts (e.g., using Git tags, build numbers, or `git describe`).
  - [x] Add a step to generate a manifest file (e.g., `build-info.txt` or `manifest.json`) containing Git commit ID, build timestamp, and semantic version, and include it in the artifacts.
- [x] **Task 4: Docker Image Build for `eaf-core` and Local Trivy Scan** (AC: #4)
  - [x] Create an optimized, multi-stage `Dockerfile` for the `eaf-core` module.
    - Ensure it uses a non-root user.
    - Optimize for layer caching and minimal image size.
  - [x] Add a pipeline step to build the Docker image.
  - [x] Tag the Docker image with the determined build version.
  - [x] Add a pipeline step to perform a Trivy vulnerability scan on the locally built Docker image (within the CI runner environment) and fail the pipeline on critical findings.
  - [x] *Note for future*: A subsequent task/story will cover publishing the image to `dcaharbor.dpcm.io` once GitHub Actions has the necessary access and authentication is configured. In der Zwischenzeit wird das Image auch zu Docker Hub gepusht.
- [x] **Task 5: Pipeline Status Signaling and Notifications** (AC: #5)
  - [x] Ensure GitHub Actions clearly displays the status (success/failure) of each pipeline step and the overall run.
  - [x] Integrate pipeline status with the Git repository (e.g., GitHub commit status checks or pull request checks).
  - [x] Configure notifications (e.g., email, Slack) for pipeline failures to be sent to the development team.
- [x] **Task 6: Logging** (AC: #6)
  - [x] Verify that GitHub Actions provides detailed and structured logs for each pipeline run.
  - [x] Confirm that logs are retained for at least 7 days (GitHub Actions default is 90 days for public repos, configurable for private).
- [x] **Task 7: Caching** (AC: #7)
  - [x] Configure GitHub Actions caching for Gradle dependencies (e.g., caching `~/.gradle/caches` and `~/.gradle/wrapper`).
  - [x] Ensure Docker layer caching is effectively utilized by the GitHub Actions build process.
- [x] **Task 8: Error Handling and Robustness** (AC: #8)
  - [x] Review pipeline steps for common points of failure (e.g., network issues when pulling dependencies).
  - [x] Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors in critical steps using GitHub Actions features.
  - [x] Ensure error messages from failed steps are clear and help in quick troubleshooting.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **CI/CD System:** GitHub Actions will be used. The workflow file should be placed in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.
- **Gradle Tasks:** The `./gradlew build cleanCheck` command must encompass compilation, unit tests, and static code analysis using Klint and Detekt. Ensure these are correctly configured in the Gradle build scripts and that `cleanCheck` properly invokes them.
- **Versioning:** A common strategy is to use Git tags for releases (e.g., `v1.0.0`) and `git describe --tags` or GitHub run numbers for development builds.
- **Docker:** Follow best practices for small, secure images. The `eaf-core` application should be runnable from this image. Publishing to `dcaharbor.dpcm.io` will be addressed in a future setup; this story focuses on building and locally scanning the image.
- **Local Docker Push:** Developers with network access and credentials for `dcaharbor.dpcm.io` can manually build and push Docker images from their local machines. This can serve as an interim solution for sharing images until the CI/CD pipeline is configured with access to the internal registry.
- **Secrets:** Secrets for `dcaharbor.dpcm.io` will be needed when publishing is configured later. For this story, no registry-specific secrets are immediately required for the build and local Trivy scan (assuming Trivy is run on the image in the runner).
- **Reproducibility:** Ensure the GitHub Actions pipeline runs in a clean, defined environment (e.g., specified runner OS and versions) to guarantee reproducible builds.
