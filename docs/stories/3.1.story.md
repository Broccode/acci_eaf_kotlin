# Story 3.1: Local User Entity & Secure Credential Storage (per Tenant)

## Status: Done

## Story

- As an EAF Developer
- I want to define and securely persist local user entities (e.g., username, hashed password, status, associated tenant ID)
- so that tenant-specific users can be authenticated locally.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The `User` entity (as defined in `docs/data-models.md#8.1.2 User (IAM User)`) is implemented within the `eaf-iam` module, focusing on attributes relevant for local authentication: `id` (UUID, primary key, system-generated, maps to `userId` in story context), `tenantId` (UUID, foreign key to `tenants.tenantId`, not null), `username` (String, must be unique per `tenantId`, subject to validation rules), `passwordHash` (String, stores the securely hashed password value, maps to `hashedPassword`), `email` (String, optional, format validation), `status` (UserStatus enum), `createdAt` (Timestamp), `updatedAt` (Timestamp). The `salt` is handled by the chosen hashing algorithm or integrated into the `passwordHash`.
2. A PostgreSQL table (`local_users`) is created via an idempotent schema migration script (using Liquibase `4.31.1` as per `docs/tech-stack.md`), including a tested rollback script. Necessary indexes (at least for `userId` (unique), (`tenantId`, `username`) (unique)) are present. The `hashedPassword` and `salt` columns are dimensioned to support modern hashing algorithms.
3. A strong, adaptive hashing algorithm (e.g., Argon2id, scrypt, or bcrypt via Spring Security `DelegatingPasswordEncoder` as suggested by `docs/security-best-practices.md` and aligning with Spring Boot from `docs/tech-stack.md`) with appropriate configuration parameters (e.g., iteration count, memory cost, parallelism) is used for password storage. Plaintext passwords are never stored or logged at any time. (FIPS 140-2/3 compliance to be considered as per `docs/security-best-practices.md`).
4. Basic backend services (internal to the `eaf-iam` module's application layer) for creating (including password hashing), retrieving (excluding password hash), updating (excluding password), and searching for local users are implemented. These services validate input data and handle database errors robustly, adhering to `docs/error-handling.md`.
5. Comprehensive unit tests (e.g., JUnit Jupiter, MockK, Kotest as per `docs/tech-stack.md` and `docs/testing-strategy.md`) cover user creation with correct password hashing, retrieval of users (without password data), and validation of user inputs (e.g., email format, uniqueness of `username` per tenant). Error cases (e.g., invalid inputs, database errors) are also tested.
6. Password complexity policies (minimum length, character types) are definable (system configuration, likely via `application.yml` in `eaf-iam`) and validated server-side during password creation/change.

  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Define columns according to `User` entity (specifically for local user attributes like `passwordHash`), ensuring `passwordHash` can accommodate modern algorithms.
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Create unique indexes on `userId` and a composite unique index on (`tenantId`, `username`).
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Implement a corresponding rollback script for the migration.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Module:** All development for this story occurs within the `eaf-iam` module.
- **Project Structure:** Adhere to `docs/project-structure.md`, specifically regarding the `eaf-iam` module and package structure (e.g., `com.acci.eaf.iam.domain`, `.application`, `.adapter.persistence`).
- **Coding Standards:** Follow `docs/coding-standards.md` (Kotlin, Spring Boot conventions, KDoc, null-safety, constructor injection).

- **Security:** Implement password hashing using Spring Security's `DelegatingPasswordEncoder` with Argon2id or bcrypt. Refer to `docs/security-best-practices.md` for secret management and hashing.
- **Database Migrations:** Use Liquibase for schema changes, as specified in `docs/tech-stack.md`.
- **Testing:** Follow guidelines in `docs/testing-strategy.md` using JUnit Jupiter, MockK, Kotest, and Testcontainers.
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling as per `docs/error-handling.md`.
