# Story 1.2: Basic `eaf-core` Module with Spring Boot & Axon Configuration

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a Developer
- I want the `eaf-core` module to be a runnable Spring Boot application with initial Axon Framework configuration
- so that the foundational CQRS/ES capabilities can be established and tested.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The `eaf-core` module includes the necessary dependencies for Spring Boot (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web` for web capabilities, `spring-boot-starter-actuator` for monitoring endpoints), managed via `build-logic`.
2. The `eaf-core` module includes the core Axon Framework dependencies (e.g., `axon-spring-boot-starter`), managed via `build-logic`. The Axon version is set to a current, stable version.
3. A basic Axon configuration is present: Command Bus, Query Bus, and Event Bus/Event Store (initially configured for in-memory operation for simple tests or a basic, local PostgreSQL connection for development tests) are correctly initialized as Spring Beans. Errors during the initialization of these Axon components (e.g., missing configuration, connection problems to the Event Store) lead to informative error messages at application startup and a failing health check.
4. The `eaf-core` application can be started successfully without runtime errors using `./gradlew :eaf-core:bootRun` (or equivalent).
5. The Spring Boot Actuator Health endpoint (`/actuator/health`) is available, reports an `UP` status, and includes basic health information for Axon components (e.g., Event Store connectivity, status of Event Processors if any are already defined).
6. A simple test Command (e.g., `PingCommand`), a corresponding Command Handler (e.g., producing a `PongEvent`), and an Event Handler (e.g., logging the `PongEvent`) are implemented in the `eaf-core` module. Sending the command (e.g., via a test REST endpoint or an integration test) results in the expected event publication and processing. Errors in command processing (e.g., no handler found, validation error in handler) lead to a defined, traceable error response (e.g., standardized JSON error structure with error code and message) or a logged exception.
7. The `application.properties` or `application.yml` file in the `eaf-core` module is structured (e.g., using Spring Profiles for `dev`, `test`, `prod`), contains placeholders or environment-specific configurations for Axon, database connection, etc., and is well-commented.
8. A basic logging configuration (e.g., via Logback, configured in `eaf-observability` and used by `eaf-core`) is present and outputs informative, structured (e.g., JSON) log information during startup and execution of the test command/event, including timestamp, log level, thread name, and logger name.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Add Spring Boot Dependencies to `eaf-core`** (AC: #1)
  - [ ] Identify current stable Spring Boot version (refer to `docs/tech-stack.md` or use a recent stable one if not specified).
  - [ ] Add `spring-boot-starter-web` to `eaf-core` via `build-logic` (e.g., in `libs.versions.toml` and applied through a convention plugin).
  - [ ] Add `spring-boot-starter-actuator` to `eaf-core` via `build-logic`.
  - [ ] Ensure `eaf-core`'s `build.gradle.kts` applies the Spring Boot plugin and necessary dependency configurations.
- [ ] **Task 2: Add Axon Framework Dependencies to `eaf-core`** (AC: #2)
  - [ ] Identify current stable Axon Framework version (refer to `docs/tech-stack.md` or use a recent stable one if not specified).
  - [ ] Add `axon-spring-boot-starter` to `eaf-core` via `build-logic`.
  - [ ] Verify dependency management in `build-logic` for Axon.
- [ ] **Task 3: Implement Basic Axon Configuration** (AC: #3)
  - [ ] Create a main application class in `eaf-core` (e.g., `com.acci.eaf.core.EafCoreApplication.kt`) annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`.
  - [ ] Configure Command Bus, Query Bus, and Event Store (in-memory for now, e.g. `EmbeddedEventStore`) as Spring Beans if not auto-configured by Axon starter.
  - [ ] Ensure error handling for Axon component initialization failures (Spring Boot should typically handle this by failing to start).
- [ ] **Task 4: Implement Test Command, Event, and Handlers** (AC: #6)
  - [ ] Define a simple `PingCommand` data class (e.g., with a `messageId: UUID`).
  - [ ] Define a simple `PongEvent` data class (e.g., with a `messageId: UUID`, `timestamp: Instant`).
  - [ ] Create a Command Handler component (e.g., `PingCommandHandler`) that:
    - Is annotated with `@Aggregate` or `@CommandHandler` in a Spring component.
    - Handles `PingCommand`.
    - Publishes `PongEvent` using `AggregateLifecycle.apply()` or directly via Event Bus.
  - [ ] Create an Event Handler component (e.g., `PongEventHandler`) that:
    - Is annotated with `@EventHandler` or `@Saga`.
    - Handles `PongEvent`.
    - Logs the event (initially, simple `println` or `java.util.logging` is fine before full logging setup).
- [ ] **Task 5: Create Test REST Endpoint (Optional but Recommended)** (AC: #6)
  - [ ] Create a Spring `@RestController` in `eaf-core`.
  - [ ] Implement a POST endpoint (e.g., `/ping`) that accepts a simple payload.
  - [ ] Inject `CommandGateway` and use it to send a `PingCommand`.
  - [ ] Return a meaningful response (e.g., the ID of the command sent or a confirmation).
- [ ] **Task 6: Configure `application.properties`/`yml`** (AC: #7)
  - [ ] Create `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or `.yml`) in `eaf-core`.
  - [ ] Add basic Spring Boot application naming (e.g., `spring.application.name=eaf-core`).
  - [ ] Add placeholders/comments for future Axon-specific configurations (e.g., event store type, serializer).
  - [ ] Consider basic profile setup (`application-dev.properties`, `application-test.properties`) even if mostly empty for now.
- [ ] **Task 7: Initial Logging Configuration** (AC: #8)
  - [ ] (Defer full `eaf-observability` setup if it's a separate story) For now, ensure Spring Boot's default Logback setup is active.
  - [ ] Add a simple log statement in the `PongEventHandler` using SLF4J API (`org.slf4j.Logger`).
  - [ ] Verify log output format during startup and when the test event is handled.
- [ ] **Task 8: Verification** (AC: #4, #5)
  - [ ] Run `./gradlew :eaf-core:bootRun` and ensure the application starts without errors.
  - [ ] Access the `/actuator/health` endpoint and verify `UP` status. Check for Axon-related health indicators if available with minimal configuration.
  - [ ] If Task 5 (REST endpoint) is implemented, send a request to it and verify the command-event flow, including log output from the event handler.
  - [ ] If no REST endpoint, write a simple Spring Boot integration test (`@SpringBootTest`) that uses `CommandGateway` to send `PingCommand` and verifies event handling (e.g., by checking logs or a mock component).

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Dependencies:** All new dependencies (Spring Boot, Axon) should be managed via `build-logic/src/main/kotlin/gradle/libs.versions.toml` and applied to `eaf-core` using convention plugins or direct configuration in `eaf-core/build.gradle.kts`. Refer to `docs/tech-stack.md` for preferred versions; if unspecified, use latest stable versions.
- **Axon Configuration:** For AC#3, Axon Spring Boot Starter auto-configures many components. Focus on ensuring the core buses are available. An in-memory `EmbeddedEventStore` is sufficient for this story.
- **Command/Event Handling (AC#6):**
  - A simple aggregate (e.g., a class annotated with `@Aggregate`) can be used to handle the command and publish the event.
  - Alternatively, a simple Spring component with `@CommandHandler` methods can be used if an aggregate feels like overkill for `PingCommand`.
- **Error Handling (AC#3, #6):**
  - Spring Boot's default behavior for startup errors is usually sufficient for AC#3.
  - For command processing errors (AC#6), if using a REST endpoint, ensure Spring's default error handling provides a traceable JSON response. Custom error structures can be deferred unless trivial to implement.
- **Logging (AC#8):**
  - The story mentions `eaf-observability`. If this module and its setup are part of a *later* story, rely on Spring Boot's default Logback configuration for now. The key is to *see* structured logs.
  - Use SLF4J API for logging (`import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory`).
- **Project Structure:** Adhere to `docs/project-structure.md` for placing new classes within `eaf-core/src/main/kotlin/com/acci/eaf/core/`. For example:
  - Application: `com.acci.eaf.core.EafCoreApplication.kt`
  - Commands/Events: `com.acci.eaf.core.api` (e.g., `PingCommand.kt`, `PongEvent.kt`)
  - Handlers: `com.acci.eaf.core.command` (e.g., `PingCommandHandler.kt`) or `com.acci.eaf.core.event` (e.g., `PongEventHandler.kt`)
  - REST Controller: `com.acci.eaf.core.interfaces.rest` (e.g., `PingController.kt`)
- **Build Verification:** Ensure `./gradlew build` and `./gradlew :eaf-core:bootRun` work as expected.
