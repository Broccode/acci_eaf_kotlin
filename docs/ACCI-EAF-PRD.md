# ACCI EAF (Axians Competence Center Infrastructure Enterprise Application Framework) Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goal, Objective and Context

* **Goal of the EAF:** Internal use to accelerate the development and standardization of enterprise software products provided to external customers. The development with ACCI EAF aims to replace the outdated, no longer extensible, and performance-limited internal "DCA" framework.
* **Focus & Value Proposition:**
  * **For the ACCI Development Team:** Significant time and cost savings in the development of new products and features, improved maintainability and testability through modern technologies and architectures, and an enhanced Developer Experience. "Liberation" from the limitations of the old system.
  * **For End Customers of ACCI Products:** Considerable gain in modern features (e.g., multitenancy, enhanced security, flexible license management, internationalization), improved performance, and a much more modern user experience for products based on the EAF.
* **Context:** The ACCI EAF is developed by the Axians Competence Center Infrastructure team and will be primarily used for enterprise segment software products that run on IBM Power Architecture (ppc64le) at customer sites, often in environments without direct internet access.

## [OPTIONAL: For Simplified PM-to-Development Workflow Only] Core Technical Decisions & Application Structure

## User Interaction and Design Goals

This section describes the high-level goals for user interaction and design of the Control Plane UI, intended for managing tenants, licenses, and tenant-specific i18n texts of the ACCI EAF.

* **Overall Vision & Experience:**
  * The user interface should convey a **professional and functional** impression.
  * **React-Admin** serves as a reference and inspiration for style and functionality, implying data-oriented, clear, and efficient operation.
  * The technology preference for the frontend of this Control Plane UI is therefore React.
* **Key Interaction Paradigms:**
  * Tabular views (Data Grids) for lists (e.g., tenants, licenses) with integrated search, filter, and sort functions.
  * Form-based input masks for creating and editing entries.
  * Detail views for displaying all relevant information about a selected entry.
* **Core Screens/Views (Conceptual for MVP):**
  * Login screen for Control Plane administrators.
  * Tenant management view (CRUD operations).
  * License management view (CRUD operations â€“ primarily for the ACCI team).
  * i18n text management view for tenants.
  * User management view (local users) within a tenant (CRUD, status, password reset).
  * RBAC assignment view (assigning roles to users) within a tenant.
  * Service account management view within a tenant (CRUD, credentials, expiration).
  * Authentication provider configuration view for tenants (LDAP, OIDC, SAML).
* **Accessibility Aspirations:**
  * For the MVP, no specific accessibility requirements beyond the standard functionality of the chosen UI framework (e.g., React-Admin) are defined (User preference: "is not necessary").
* **Target Devices/Platforms:**
  * Primary focus: **Desktop web browsers**.
  * Basic responsive display for tablets (viewing core information) is desirable.
* **Branding / Style Guide Constraints:**
  * The Control Plane UI should be designed **neutrally**, without specific ACCI branding elements, to emphasize its functional character.
* **User Feedback & Iteration:**
  * **Initial MVP:** Internal "Dogfooding" & direct feedback from the ACCI team.
  * **Pre-Pilot/Pilot Phase:** Usability tests with "Proxy Users" (internal staff in customer admin roles) or early pilot customers.
  * **Iteration Process:** Collected feedback will be consolidated and prioritized by the PM, and implemented in subsequent development cycles in coordination with the development team.

## Out of Scope / Future Considerations

* **Out of Scope for MVP (explicitly by user decision or marked as TBD):**
  * Detailed elaboration of a complete "Out of Scope" list (User preference: "cannot be said at this time").
  * Support for Right-to-Left (RTL) languages (User preference: "Not planned").
  * Specific training needs and formal training plans for developers or support teams (User preference: "We'll clarify after the MVP").
  * Detailed support and maintenance process for the EAF (User preference: "We'll clarify after the MVP").
  * Fixed release frequency for the EAF (User preference: "We'll clarify after the MVP").
  * Detailed VM specifications for EAF components (User preference: "We'll clarify after the MVP").
  * Backup/Recovery & DR strategies for EAF's own services (User preference: "mark as TBD").
  * Data migration from the legacy "DCA" system (User preference: "not for the MVP").
  * Comprehensive UI for role and permission definition in the RBAC module of the Control Plane (MVP focuses on assigning existing roles).
  * "Password forgotten" flow for the Control Plane UI (MVP focuses on a manual admin process).
* **Future Considerations (Potential future enhancements):**
  * Full-fledged ABAC implementation.
  * Advanced features of the Online License Activation Server.
  * Dynamic loading/unloading of plugins at runtime (beyond ServiceLoader, e.g., with OSGi or similar technologies).
  * Support for additional databases for EAF operation.
  * Integrated feedback mechanisms and UI analytics for the Control Plane.
  * Automated self-service functions for tenant admins in the Control Plane that go beyond the MVP.

## Technical Assumptions

1. **Target Platform:** The ACCI EAF and all applications based on it must be developed and optimized for the **IBM Power Architecture (ppc64le)**.
2. **Operating Environment (MVP Focus):**
    * The **primary target deployment** for the ACCI EAF and applications based on it within the MVP scope is on **Virtual Machines (VMs)**.
    * The EAF and applications based on it **must be designed and runnable in environments without direct internet access (air-gapped environments)**. This also includes aspects like offline licensing and deployment.
    * The use of **public cloud platforms (like AWS, Azure, GCP) or Kubernetes-based environments is not in focus for the MVP and the initial core architecture of the EAF**. The EAF should be designed to operate without dependencies on specific cloud services or Kubernetes as a runtime environment.
    * Although not the primary focus, the EAF's design should, wherever practical and without compromising the primary goals (VMs, offline capability), not create unnecessary hurdles for *eventual future* adaptation or operation of *individual products based on it* in cloud or Kubernetes environments.
3. **Core Technology Stack:** Kotlin (JVM), Spring Boot, Axon Framework, PostgreSQL, Gradle.
4. **Architecture Style:** Modular Monolith.
5. **Key Architectural Patterns:** Hexagonal Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), Event Sourcing (ES).
6. **Repository Structure:** Monorepo.
7. **Frontend Technology (for Control Plane UI):** React (oriented towards React-Admin style).
8. **Integration Points (MVP):** External Auth Providers (LDAP, OIDC, SAML), Online License Activation Server, SMTP server for email dispatch.

## Success Metrics & KPIs (MVP)

(Targets within the first 6 months after MVP deployment)

**1. EAF Adoption and Utilization:**

* **KPI 1a:** At least **1-2 significant internal pilot projects/modules** actively use the ACCI EAF.
* **KPI 1b:** Pilot projects utilize at least **60-70%** of the relevant, available EAF core modules.
**2. Developer Productivity and Satisfaction:**
* **KPI 2a:** Onboarding time for new developers (with Kotlin/Java experience) for a standard task using EAF: **< 2-3 working days**.
* **KPI 2b:** Qualitative survey of core EAF users shows >75% agreement on improvement over DCA and increased productivity.
* **KPI 2c:** Developers report a significant (>40-50% estimated) reduction in boilerplate code.
**3. Product Quality & Modernization:**
* **KPI 3a:** Pilot projects successfully implement at least one modern EAF core feature that was difficult/impossible with DCA.
* **KPI 3b:** No critical bugs reported in used EAF core modules within the first 3 months of pilot usage.
**Timeframe for achieving these initial KPIs:** 6 months after MVP deployment.

**Subject:** Architecture Design for ACCI Enterprise Application Framework (ACCI EAF) - MVP

Dear Solution Architect,

This document serves as the foundation for the architectural design of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the new **ACCI Enterprise Application Framework (ACCI EAF)**. The goal of this framework is to significantly accelerate, standardize, and improve the quality of the development and maintenance of our enterprise software products for external customers, particularly as a replacement for our outdated "DCA" framework.

### Project Goals (Summary)

* Accelerate the development and standardization of enterprise software products.
* Reduce time and costs in product development.
* Improve the maintainability, security, and performance of end products.
* Provide modern features such as multitenancy, flexible IAM, and license management.

### Core Requirements (Summary)

The ACCI EAF is to be developed as a modular monolith and provide the following core functionalities (MVP) via dedicated modules:

* Comprehensive Multitenancy (RLS, context management, admin API).
* Identity & Access Management (IAM) (local users, service accounts, RBAC, configuration of external providers like LDAP/AD, OIDC, SAML2).
* License Management (time-based, hardware-bound for ppc64le CPU cores, offline/online activation).
* Internationalization (i18n) (loading translations, formatting, language switching, tenant-specific customizations).
* A Plugin System (based on Java ServiceLoader).
* Observability (structured logging, metrics via Micrometer/Prometheus, health checks).
* A web-based Control Plane (Admin UI, React-based) for tenant, user, license, and i18n management.

Detailed functional requirements are documented in this PRD in the form of 10 Epics with User Stories and Acceptance Criteria.

Key Non-Functional Requirements include:

* **Target Platform & Operation:** Exclusively ppc64le VMs, no Cloud/Kubernetes for MVP, offline/air-gapped capability.
