# Epic 7: Plugin System Foundation
>
> This document is a granulated shard from the main "ACCI-EAF-PRD.md" focusing on "Epic 7: Plugin System Foundation".

*Description:* Implements the `eaf-plugin-system` module (e.g., using ServiceLoader API) allowing for basic extensibility of the EAF by other modules. Includes a simple example plugin.
*Value:* Demonstrates and provides the core EAF extensibility.

**Story 7.1: Define EAF Extension Points using ServiceLoader Interfaces**

* **As an** EAF Developer, **I want** to define clear Java/Kotlin interfaces within `eaf-core` (or a dedicated `eaf-plugin-api` module with minimal dependencies) that serve as standardized extension points (Service Provider Interfaces - SPIs) for plugins, **so that** different parts of the EAF and applications based on it can be extended consistently and type-safely.
* **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
    1. At least 2-3 distinct, business-relevant extension points are identified for the MVP and defined in the `eaf-plugin-api` module (or `eaf-core`) (e.g., `TenantLifecycleListener` to react to tenant events, `CustomCommandValidator` for additional command validation logic, `UIMenuItemProvider` to dynamically extend navigation menus in EAF-based UIs).
    2. For each extension point, a clear, well-documented Java/Kotlin interface is defined. The interface methods are precisely named, their parameters and return types are clearly typed, and expected behavior and potential exceptions are specified (KDoc/JavaDoc).
    3. These interfaces are designed as a stable, public API for plugin developers. Considerations for versioning SPIs and avoiding breaking changes are noted in the design documentation.
    4. Initial documentation for these extension point interfaces is created, explaining their purpose, typical use cases, and basic implementation guidelines.
    5. The EAF's core logic (in relevant modules like `eaf-core`, `eaf-iam`, etc.) is refactored or designed to discover, load, and securely invoke implementations of these interfaces using Java's `ServiceLoader` mechanism at appropriate points in the program flow. Errors during the invocation of a plugin method (e.g., exception in plugin code) must not jeopardize the core functionality of the EAF (e.g., through `try-catch` blocks and appropriate logging).

**Story 7.2: Implement Plugin Discovery and Loading Mechanism**

* **As an** EAF Developer, **I want** the `eaf-plugin-system` module to implement a robust mechanism for discovering, loading, and managing instances of plugins at runtime (or application startup) using Java's `ServiceLoader`, **so that** EAF-based applications can be easily and standardly extended.
* **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
    1. The `eaf-plugin-system` module (or a core component in `eaf-core`) contains logic that uses `ServiceLoader.load(MyExtensionPointInterface.class)` to find all plugin implementations registered in the classpath for the extension points defined in Story 7.1.
    2. Discovered plugin instances are managed. This includes:
        * Secure initialization of plugin instances (considering Dependency Injection if plugins are Spring Beans, which requires additional configuration with `ServiceLoader`, or ensuring plugins have simple, parameterless constructors).
        * Making plugin instances available to the EAF's core logic (e.g., via a registry or direct passing to consuming components).
    3. The system handles scenarios appropriately where no plugins are found for an extension point (does not lead to errors but operates with default behavior). If multiple plugins implement the same point, either all are invoked (e.g., for listeners) or there is a defined strategy for selection or prioritization (if only one implementation is allowed â€“ for MVP, all are invoked if sensible).
    4. Informative logging (DEBUG or INFO level) is implemented to indicate which plugins for which extension points are discovered, loaded, and, if applicable, initialized. Errors during loading or initialization of a plugin are clearly logged (WARN or ERROR) and do not cause the main application to crash; instead, the faulty plugin is skipped.
    5. The process by which a plugin (as a separate JAR/Gradle module) registers its service implementations for discovery by `ServiceLoader` (i.e., by creating a file in the `META-INF/services/` directory with the fully qualified name of the interface, containing the fully qualified name of the implementation class) is clearly and detailedly documented for plugin developers.
    6. The performance of the plugin loading process at application startup is monitored and must not disproportionately slow down the startup.

**Story 7.3: Develop a Simple Example Plugin Module**

* **As an** EAF Developer (and as a future plugin developer), **I want** a simple example plugin developed as a separate Gradle module within the monorepo, **so that** I can understand how to create, build, and integrate a plugin with the EAF and how it interacts with the EAF.
* **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
    1. A new Gradle module (e.g., `eaf-example-plugin-auditor`) is created in the monorepo as a standalone project. It only has dependencies on the `eaf-plugin-api` module (or `eaf-core` where SPIs reside) and not vice-versa.
    2. This module implements at least one of the EAF extension point interfaces defined in Story 7.1 (e.g., a `TenantLifecycleListener` that listens for tenant creation).
    3. The example plugin provides simple but clearly verifiable functionality (e.g., logs a message with tenant ID when a new tenant is created via the API from Epic 2, or contributes a dummy entry to a list managed by another EAF service).
    4. The example plugin correctly declares its service implementations in its `META-INF/services/` directory structure.
    5. When the EAF core application (e.g., `eaf-core` or a dedicated test application that loads plugins) starts and the `eaf-example-plugin-auditor` module (as a JAR) is included in its classpath, the plugin is discovered and loaded by the `eaf-plugin-system` (Story 7.2).
    6. The functionality of the example plugin is demonstrably invoked during corresponding EAF actions (e.g., creating a tenant) and is observable (e.g., through the logged message or the contributed dummy entry).
    7. The example plugin includes its own unit tests for its internal logic.
    8. The structure, build process (`build.gradle.kts`), and configuration of the example plugin are minimal and serve as a clear template for the future development of other plugins.

**Story 7.4: Document EAF Plugin Development Process**

* **As a** Developer intending to create a plugin for an EAF-based application, **I want** clear and comprehensive documentation on how to develop, configure, build, package, and deploy a plugin in an EAF application, **so that** I can effectively, securely, and standard-compliantly extend the application's functionality.
* **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
    1. The developer documentation (see Epic 10) includes a dedicated section on plugin development.
    2. This section describes in detail all officially supported EAF extension point interfaces (SPIs from Story 7.1), their methods, expected behavior, and usage examples.
    3. The documentation explains the Java `ServiceLoader` mechanism, the creation of `META-INF/services/` files, and how a plugin service is correctly registered.
    4. A step-by-step guide, using the `eaf-example-plugin-auditor` (from Story 7.3) as a reference, leads the developer through the entire plugin creation process, from module definition in the Gradle build to verifying plugin functionality.
    5. Important considerations for plugin developers are covered:
        * Best practices for designing plugin implementations (e.g., statelessness, performance aspects, error handling within the plugin to avoid impacting the host system).
        * Dependency management for plugins (how to minimize conflicts with EAF-internal or other plugin dependencies).
        * Basic guidance on versioning plugins in relation to the EAF version and SPI versions.
        * Security aspects (e.g., that plugins run in the same security context as the EAF and the resulting responsibilities for the plugin developer).
    6. A troubleshooting guide for common problems during plugin development or integration is included.
    7. The documentation is current with the implemented functionality and is updated upon changes to SPIs or the loading mechanism.
