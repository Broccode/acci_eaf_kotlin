**`### Critical Deficiencies`**

* No critical deficiencies were identified that would prevent handing this PRD draft to the architect for the design phase. All essential elements for defining the MVP are present.

**`### Recommendations`**

1. **Formalize PRD Document:** Transfer the content created in this interactive session (including the English PRD text, this completed checklist, the glossary, the DoD, the Epic dependencies) into a formal, versioned Markdown document based on `prd-tmpl.txt`.
2. **Create Visuals:** Develop and integrate the recommended Mermaid diagrams (EAF Component Overview, Control Plane User Journey, Epic Dependencies, Important Data Flow) into the formal PRD document.
3. **Develop "ACCI Kotlin Coding Standards v1.0":** Initiate the creation of this document, as referenced in NFR 4b.
4. **Track TBD Items:** Maintain a list of all identified "To Be Defined (TBD)" items (e.g., explicit "Out of Scope" list, backup/DR strategy for EAF services, training plans, VM specifications, data retention policies) and plan their clarification at appropriate future times.
5. **Iterate on KPIs:** Review and refine the initially defined KPIs once baseline data becomes available and pilot projects provide further insights.
6. **Establish Organizational Processes:** Consider establishing or clarifying internal team processes for communicating PRD updates and formal approval procedures by multiple stakeholders, if deemed necessary for future iterations.

**`### Final Decision`**

* **READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and Epics are comprehensive, appropriately structured, and detailed enough to serve as a basis for architectural design. The defined TBD items do not hinder the commencement of architectural work for the MVP.
